            <br>
            <p> Once again, greenhouse gases are gases found in our atmosphere that can absorb infrared waves from the
                sun; these gases re-emit the infrared reflected from the earthâ€™s surface. Instead of allowing the
                infrared waves to pass and leave the atmosphere,
                greenhouse gases trap then re-emit half the heat to space and a half back to the earth. There are a few
                <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases" target="blank">main GHGs</a>, and
                here they are listed in order of magnitude: Carbon Dioxide CO<sub>2</sub>, Methane CH<sub>4</sub>,
                Nitrous Oxide N<sub>2</sub>O, Fluorinated gas derivatives YF<sub>x</sub> and
                Hydrofluorocarbons HFCs.

                anyway; they are broken down into translational motion, rotational motion and vibrational motion.
                However, only vibrational motion is important concerning the absorption of infrared waves. Vibrational
                motion
                explains that molecules tend to vibrate as energy is supplied to them, this causes periodic disturbances
                between bonded atoms and their centers of mass; in our case, vibrational motion allows certain gaseous
                molecules to interact with infrared waves. To simplify, carbon dioxide will be used as the model for
                GHGs. Although CO<sub>2</sub> has a linear molecular geometry, it can nonetheless experience four
                different
                vibrational modes: asymmetric stretch, symmetric stretch and two bending. Each of these four modes, can

                Why are three of four modes IR active in CO<sub>2</sub>?
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>We must first address how to find the number of vibrational modes in a molecule. The equation is 3N - 5
                for linear molecules and 3N - 6 for non-linear, where N represents the number of atoms in a particular
                molecule. Generally speaking, only if a vibrational mode induces an <a

                    artificial dipole</a> will it absorb an IR photon.
                Therefore, symmetric stretching in CO<sub>2</sub> is not IR active whereas the other modes are.

                Bonds as springs
            </h2>

            <br>
            <p>To understand this complex phenomenon, we must first address that bonds are not stationary; rather, they
                act like springs that can compress and expand when energy is supplied. </p>

            <p>Think of this as pulling on one end of a spring with the other attached to a sturdy wall. When tugging,
                the spring
                absorbs the kinetic energy (movement) produced by your arms and converts it into elastic potential
                energy; the spring is now in a state of stress. When you let go of the spring, its potential energy
                converts
                back into kinetic and returns to its <a

                    position</a> or where it would be at rest. </p>

            <p>So when a carbon dioxide molecule makes contact with infrared waves that match one of three discrete
                values, it will
                absorb a photon as a spring would absorb E<sub>k</sub>. The molecule is now in an excited state;
                it can now release its newly gained energy
                in a few ways:</p>

                        The photon is re-emitted in a fraction of a second upon absorption:
