                    Spectrophotometry is a branch of chemistry focusing on how light interacts with aqueous solutions.
                    This
                    phenomenon is due to the existence of atomic/molecular orbitals of different energy levels, which
                    attribute to discrete wavelengths of light. In our case, we can use this to measure the
                    concentration of
                    a given chemical substance in solution, knowing its absorbance wavelength. Concentration can be
                    measured
                    by comparing the intensity of the light before entering a solution to the intensity after it travels
                    through solution:
                    <br>
                    <equation>\[A = \varepsilon lc:(1)\]</equation>
                    <br>
                    <div>Absorbance is also equal to the log of the ratio of the incident intensity over the transmitted
                        intensity:
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <equation>\[A = \log(\frac{I_{o}}{I}):(2)\]</equation>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        Setting (1) and (2) equal, we receive (3)
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <equation>\[\log(\frac{I_{o}}{I}) = \varepsilon lc:(3)\]</equation>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        And finally, solving for concentration, we receive (4) where
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <equation>\[c=\frac{\log \frac{I_{o}}{I}}{\varepsilon l}:(4)\]
                    </equation>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        Depending on the chemical substance scrutinized, a certain wavelength in the electromagnetic
                        spectrum is favoured to be absorbed. So, when the specific light is provided to a chemical
                        substance
                        in solution, the transmitted intensity will differ from the incident. In general, the lower the
                        intensity of the transmitted light, the higher the concentration since more light is absorbed,
                        meaning that there is a larger quantity of particles per unit volume. Contrarily, the higher the
                        intensity of transmitted light, the lower the concentration since less light is absorbed, which
                        can be attributed to the fact that there are fewer particles per unit volume.

                    As seen in the diagram, the electron is promoted when a wavelength of light is supplied. Our design
                    functions thanks to this phenomenon - absorption or absorbance. This is how the energy is absorbed;
                    electrons are promoted to unstable, excited states, which are higher in energy and are further, on
                    average, from the nucleus.
                </div>
                <div>
                    The mathematical relationship that can characterize this phenomenon was discovered by Max Planck:
                </div>
                <br>
                <equation>\[E=hv\]</equation>
                <br>
                <div>Where E is the energy of the frequency of light, v is the frequency, and h is Planck's constant.
                    The energy, E, can also represent the difference in energy between orbitals when electrons enter an
                    excited or ground state.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    Therefore, logically, the more ions there are in solution, the substance will absorb the more
                    likely, light, ultimately decreasing the intensity of light after traversing the sample. This is why
                    the quantity of light absorbed by a solution is directly proportional to its concentration.

                <h2>Lasers and LDRs</h2>
                <div>
                    This is a simplified version of the circuitry of our product designed on Fritzing. Note that some of
                    these components will not be used; for example, the breadboard is just for the visuals. In reality,
                    the design will be soldered. The two components on the breadboard are the Light Dependent Resistors
                    (LDRs) which are the sensors in our configuration. The two sensors detect light in different
                    spectrums because nitrate and phosphate ions have different mean wavelengths in their absorption
                    spectrum (220 and 420 nm, respectively). The LDR in blue detects UV light, and the smaller LDR
                    detects visible light. The lasers also emit light of corresponding wavelength: the leftmost emitting
                    violet light, and the right, producing UV light.
                </div>
                <h2>Water Level Sensor</h2>
                <div>
                    To conserve the battery life of our product, the laser will not be testing at every instant but only
                    when there is water. As soon as our water level (in red) sensor reads a value, the laser will start
                    measuring and will be shot off in intervals of 10 seconds. The laser will only stop after the water
                    level sensor reads a null value. The data collected by the system will be averaged out, and outliers
                    (low concentrations) will be discarded.
