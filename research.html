        <h3>What are our future improvements?</h3>
        <div class="one">
            With adequate time, AquaDux would filter microbeads and detect oils in shower products. Carbon Blocks faucet
            filters, reverse osmosis filters, and distillation filters can be attached to AquaDux to filter
            microplastics. Moreover, ultraviolet radiation detects oil contamination at peak intensity of 365 nm, where
            visible radiation emits and intensity is measured with a photocell. These would broaden our database of
            contaminants and continue educating users on water quality.
        </div>

        <h3>Why should you care?</h3>
        <div>
            Residential water consumption has increased by 15% since the pandemic. The stay-at-home order in America
            skyrocketed net water usage levels from 32 to 59 gallons in 30 days. Yet the more water consumed, the more
            contaminants arise. Not only does this harm the environment, but this harms human food and water resources
            as well. For example, pollutants feed algae, increasing algal blooms and risking all aquatic life. With this
            trend, the
            fishing industry will suffer, surrounding areas smell putrid, and nearby plants are affected which may
            trigger the founder effect. Seeds of plants near aquatic areas may travel by wind, water, or other animals,
            and land in new areas with harmful bacteria in their genetic configurations as a result of pollutants from
            their original habitat. Like invasive species, diseases can easily spread from here.
            <br><br>
            Not only that, but you should care about your water consumption and water quality because if you don’t, the
            government may get involved. Similar to the carbon tax, who knows if a water tax will be implemented in a
            few years? It is up to everyone to reduce their water consumption and improve their water quality to avoid
            further consequences.
        </div>

        <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
        <div>
            Spread the word! Share AquaDux with your friends, family, and community! Interact with our social media, and
            purchase our device to monitor your water quality. It is up to all of us to help the water issue.
            Furthermore, learn about what some communities are doing to help the cause, and try to promote healthy and
            sustainable actions in your own community or household. Also, acknowledging that you have flaws, concerning
            your water usage, accept these, and think about what you can do to reduce these oversights. Finally,
            understand that poor water quality/usage is a communal problem and affects every one of us.
        </div>

        <h3>Why not a filter?</h3>
        <div>
            Originally, we had planned to implement a filter. However, after conducting research, it was evident that
            detecting specific ions was far more difficult. As SHADs, we love a challenge. We knew that with this once
            in a lifetime design opportunity with some of the strongest student leaders in Canada, we needed to reach
            for the stars. We wanted to design something new and innovative that the market hasn’t seen before.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, our main priority is to educate Canadians on the contaminants in their water, and foster
            respect through the product. If we were to only control their quality of water, the educational aspect is
            minimized and hindered. With a sensor, users can be aware of the contaminants in their showers and act
            accordingly with our various recommendations.
        </div>



        <h3>Why quality over quantity?</h3>
        <div>

            As stated before, quality is far more difficult to control compared to quantity. If we want to implement
            real and long-term change, that means addressing a problem that hasn’t been significantly addressed, but is
            just as crucial to solving the water issue. We hope that through educating Canadians on their water quality,
            they may become more mindful of their quantity as well. In the future, we hope to expand to detect and
            filter other contaminants and possibly control quantity as well.
